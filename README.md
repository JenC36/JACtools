# JACtools Package (March 2021)

A set of awesome functions that I have written, adapted from other folks posted functions, or taken from other sources; links are generally included with the individual functions.
These are functions I use frequently and so I created this package.
Functions include connecting to Oracle databases, computing mode and anti-modes, plotting multiple ggplots on a page, creating common legends in faceted ggplots, and etc.
