# JACtools Package 
Last updated: March 2021

A set of awesome functions that I have written, have adapted from other folks' posted functions, or taken from other sources; links are generally included with the individual functions that I did not write.
These are functions I use frequently and so I created this package.
Functions include connecting to Oracle databases, computing mode and anti-modes, plotting multiple ggplots on a page, creating common legends in faceted ggplots, and etc.

To install, run: 
devtools::install_github("JenC36/JACtools")
